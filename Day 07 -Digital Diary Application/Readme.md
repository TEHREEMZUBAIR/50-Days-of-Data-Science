# 📘 Day 6: OOP Basics in Python
## Instructions:
### 📝 Introduction to Classes and Objects:

A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. 🏗️
Define a class called Dog 🐶 that represents basic attributes and behaviors.
### 🔧 Using the __init__ Method:

The __init__ method acts as a constructor and is automatically called when an object is instantiated. 🔄
Create attributes for the Dog class (like name) using the __init__ method and the self keyword to initialize them.
### 🔒 Encapsulation:

Protect object data by using private attributes (prefix them with double underscores __) 🛡️.
Implement getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes.
### 👪 Inheritance and Polymorphism:

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. 📦 Create base and derived classes to demonstrate this concept.
Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. 🌀 Implement method overriding to demonstrate this.
### ⚙️ Task Workflow:

#### Write Python code snippets for the following:
🐾 Create a Dog class with class and instance attributes.
🐕 Instantiate multiple objects from the class.
🔑 Use getter and setter methods for encapsulation.
🧱 Define base and derived classes to implement inheritance.
🎭 Apply polymorphism by overriding methods.
📚 Important OOP Concepts to Cover:

#### Class Attributes: Shared among all instances. 🌍
Instance Attributes: Unique to each object. 🔑
Encapsulation: Control access to object attributes. 🔒
Inheritance: Reuse code by inheriting properties from another class. 👩‍👦
Polymorphism: Overriding methods to change behavior. 🎭
