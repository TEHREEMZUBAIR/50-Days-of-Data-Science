
### Task Overview
This task involves working with a Jupyter Notebook titled **data-cleaning.ipynb**. You will learn various techniques for cleaning datasets, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

### What We Have Done in This Task
In this task, we have accomplished the following:

- **Identified Missing Values**: We learned how to detect missing values in our dataset and explored methods to handle them, such as imputation or removal.
- **Corrected Data Types**: We examined the importance of data types and practiced converting them to appropriate formats for analysis.
- **Removed Duplicates**: We identified duplicate entries in our dataset and applied techniques to remove them, ensuring data integrity.
- **Standardized Data**: We explored methods for standardizing data formats (e.g., date formats, categorical variables) to maintain consistency across the dataset.
- **Documented Our Process**: Throughout the notebook, we documented our steps and findings to create a clear record of our data cleaning process.

### Objectives
- Understand the importance of data cleaning in data science.
- Learn techniques to identify and fix data quality issues.
- Prepare datasets for further analysis or modeling.
