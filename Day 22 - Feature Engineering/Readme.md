
### Overview
Today, we delved into the world of feature engineering, a vital step in the data science pipeline. By transforming our dataset, we aim to extract more meaningful insights and improve model accuracy.

### 🛠️ What We Did Today
1. **Understanding Feature Engineering**:
   - We explored the importance of feature engineering in enhancing model performance.
   - Discussed how well-engineered features can lead to better predictions.

2. **Techniques Covered**:
   - **Creating New Features**: 
     - Derived new features from existing ones (e.g., combining date fields).
   - **Handling Missing Values**: 
     - Implemented strategies to deal with missing data effectively.
   - **Scaling and Normalization**:
     - Applied scaling techniques to standardize feature values.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
     - Used methods like one-hot encoding to convert categorical data into numerical format.

3. **Practical Implementation**:
   - We worked through a Jupyter Notebook (`feature-engineering-2.ipynb`), applying these techniques step-by-step.
   - Each section of the notebook included code snippets and explanations for clarity.

### 📊 Key Takeaways
- Feature engineering is essential for improving model performance.
