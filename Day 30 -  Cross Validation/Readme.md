## Overview

This notebook is part of **Day 30 of the 50 Days of Data Science** series. The focus of this task is on understanding and applying **evaluation techniques for regression models**. The notebook covers key metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression models, providing hands-on practice with various techniques used to assess model predictions.

The task includes:
- Introduction to regression evaluation metrics
- Implementation of regression models
- Performance evaluation using various metrics

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup
Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the required packages installed. You can set up the environment by running the following commands:

```bash
# Install necessary libraries
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

Alternatively, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies more efficiently:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.\env\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
source env/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### 2. Jupyter Notebook Installation
If you don’t have Jupyter installed, use the following command to install it:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Task Details

### Objective
The objective of this task is to evaluate the performance of regression models by utilizing various **regression evaluation metrics**. The notebook will walk through model training and evaluation using metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)
- Adjusted R-squared
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

### Dataset
The notebook includes loading a dataset for regression analysis, preparing it for model building, and evaluating the models using the metrics mentioned above. Preprocessing steps, such as feature scaling and handling missing values, are included.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset
   - Handle missing values and outliers (if any)
   - Scale features using techniques such as StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train regression models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, or Random Forest Regressor, on the dataset
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation

3. **Evaluation Techniques**:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors between predicted and actual values.
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the MSE, which gives an error value in the same unit as the target variable.
   - **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
   - **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusts R² to account for the number of predictors in the model.
   - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures the accuracy of predictions as a percentage of error.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize residuals (difference between predicted and actual values) using a residual plot
   - Plot the comparison between predicted and actual values to assess model performance

### How to Run the Notebook

1. **Download the Notebook**: Clone or download the repository containing the notebook file `task-28.ipynb`.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the notebook is located, and launch Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**:
   In the Jupyter interface, click on `task-28.ipynb` to open the notebook.

4. **Execute the Notebook**:
   - Run each code cell by pressing `Shift + Enter` or clicking the `Run` button.
   - Ensure that you run the cells in sequence to avoid errors.
   - Outputs such as regression model evaluations and visualizations will appear below the respective code cells.

### Customization Options

You can enhance the task by:
- Adding more regression models such as **Lasso Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, or **Gradient Boosting Regressor**.
- Trying out additional evaluation metrics, such as **Median Absolute Error** or **Explained Variance Score**.
- Testing the models on different datasets to assess their performance across various domains.

## Output

Upon completion, the notebook will output:
- Evaluation metrics for each regression model
- Visualizations for residuals and predicted vs. actual values
- A comparison of different models’ performance based on the evaluation metrics

## Conclusion

This task will help you gain a deeper understanding of:
- How to evaluate regression models using various metrics
- How to interpret the performance of regression models
- How to apply these techniques to real-world datasets
