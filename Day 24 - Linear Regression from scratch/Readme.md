## 📚 **Key Concepts**

### 1. **Linear Regression** 📈
- **Linear Model**: A model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the output (y).
- **Hypothesis Function**: \( h(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1x \)
- **Cost Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure the accuracy of the model.

### 2. **Gradient Descent Optimization** 🚀
- **Minimizing the Cost Function**: Iteratively adjusting the model's parameters to reduce the cost.
- **Learning Rate**: A key parameter that controls how large the steps are in each iteration of gradient descent.

## 🚶‍♂️ **Step-by-Step Guide**

### 1. **Understanding the Linear Regression Model**
   - **Hypothesis Function**: The model predicts \( y \) based on a linear combination of the input variables.
   - **Error Calculation**: Use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to calculate how far off your predictions are from the actual values.

### 2. **Gradient Descent**
   - **Initialize Parameters**: Start with some random values for \( \theta_0 \) and \( \theta_1 \).
   - **Iteratively Update Parameters**: Use the gradient descent algorithm to adjust the parameters so that the cost function decreases with each iteration.

### 3. **Visualizing the Results** 📉
   - **Plot the Data Points**: Scatter plot your data points.
   - **Plot the Regression Line**: After training, draw the best-fit line over the scatter plot to see how well your model performs.
