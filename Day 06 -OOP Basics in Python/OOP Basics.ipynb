This prevents them from being accessed directly from outside the class.\n\n**Getters and Setters:** Methods get_brand() and get_os() are provided to access the private attributes. The set_os() method is provided to change the os attribute, with a rule that if the brand is \"Apple\", the OS must start with \"iOS\".\n\n**Validation in Setter:** The set_os() method includes a rule to ensure that an iPhone can only have an OS that starts with \"iOS\". If an invalid OS is provided, a ValueError is raised.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Abstraction**\n\n- It hides unnecessary code details from the user.
