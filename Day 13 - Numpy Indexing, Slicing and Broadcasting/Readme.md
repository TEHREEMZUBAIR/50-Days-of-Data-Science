# Day 13 - Mastering NumPy Indexing, Slicing & Broadcasting üéØ

Welcome to Day 13 of the 50 Days of Data Science Challenge! Today, you will strengthen your skills in NumPy by learning how to efficiently manipulate arrays through indexing, slicing, and broadcasting. This task will also introduce you to advanced concepts such as applying functions to array indices and calculating norms. Let's get started! üöÄ

## Task Instructions üìù

1. **Basic Indexing and Slicing**  
   Given a 2D array, extract a subarray of shape (2, 2) from the top-left corner.

2. **Advanced Indexing**  
   Select all odd elements from a 1D array and print them.

3. **Fancy Indexing**  
   From a 3x3 matrix, extract the rows with indices 0 and 2.

4. **Slicing with Broadcasting**  
   Add a scalar value to a slice of a 2D array (i.e., add 2 to the second row).

5. **Condition-Based Indexing**  
   From a 1D array of random integers, extract all elements greater than 10.

6. **Replacing Elements Based on Condition**  
   Given a 2D array of shape (5, 5), replace all elements greater than 15 with the value 0.

7. **Array Broadcasting**  
   Perform element-wise multiplication of a 1D array and a 2D array using broadcasting.

8. **Reshaping and Transposing Arrays**  
   Create a 3D array of shape (4, 3, 2), then calculate and print the Euclidean norm along the third axis.

9. **Array Operations Based on Indices**  
   Generate a 2D array of shape (5, 5) where each element is the result of a function applied to its indices (e.g., element at (i, j) = i * j).
