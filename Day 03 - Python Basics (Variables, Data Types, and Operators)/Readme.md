# 🐍 **Task 3: Python Basics (Variables, Data Types, and Operators)**

### 👩‍💻 **Overview**
Welcome to Day 3 of your Data Science journey! 🎉 In this task, you'll dive into the fundamental building blocks of Python programming—variables, data types, and operators. These concepts are critical for understanding how to manipulate data and perform operations in Python.

### 🌟 **Objectives**
By the end of this task, you will:
- 📌 Understand how to declare and use variables in Python.
- 🎯 Explore various data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans) and how to work with them.
- 🧮 Learn about different operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical) and their usage.
  
### 📚 **Topics Covered**
1. **Variables**: How to declare, assign, and work with variables in Python.
2. **Data Types**: Overview of Python’s data types including `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
3. **Operators**: An introduction to arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
   
### ⚙️ **Task Details**

#### 📝 1. **Python Variables**
- Python doesn’t require you to declare variables before using them. You can assign values directly.
- Variables can change their type based on the value assigned.
- Use `type()` to check the data type of a variable.
- Variable names are **case-sensitive**.

**Example:**
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

#### 📊 2. **Data Types**
- **Integer**: Whole numbers like `5` or `-10`.
- **Float**: Decimal numbers like `3.14`.
- **String**: Textual data, enclosed in quotes, e.g., `"Hello"`.
- **Boolean**: Logical values, either `True` or `False`.

Use casting to convert between types, for example:
```python
x = int(5.5)  # Converts float to int
y = str(123)  # Converts integer to string
```

#### ➕ 3. **Operators**
- **Arithmetic Operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`): Perform mathematical calculations.
- **Comparison Operators** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`): Compare values.
- **Logical Operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`): Combine conditions for decision making.

### 🛠️ **Requirements**
- Python installed on your machine or access to a cloud-based Python environment (like Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook).
  
### 🔑 **How to Complete the Task**
1. 🏗️ **Set up your environment**: Ensure you have Python installed or use Jupyter Notebook.
2. 🖊️ **Experiment with variables**: Try different data types and use `print()` to display the values.
3. 🎯 **Practice operators**: Perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations and observe the results.
4. 💾 **Save your work**: Document your learning by adding comments and explanations in Markdown cells.

### 📦 **Deliverables**
- A well-organized Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing:
  - Examples of variable declarations, data types, and operators.
  - Markdown cells with explanations and comments.
  
### 🚀 **Bonus Challenge**
Explore how Python handles dynamic typing and experiment with changing variable types on the fly! 🎉
