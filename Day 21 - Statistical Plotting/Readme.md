
## Overview
Welcome to Day 21 of the 50 Days of Data Science! Today, we focused on **Statistical Plotting** using Python. This task is designed to enhance your data visualization skills, which are crucial for analyzing and interpreting data effectively.

## Objectives 🎯
- Understand the importance of data visualization in data science.
- Learn how to create various types of statistical plots using Python libraries.
- Gain hands-on experience with real datasets.

## Libraries Used 📚
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.

## Task Instructions 📝

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
     ```

2. **Load Your Dataset**:
   - Use a dataset of your choice or the provided dataset in the `statistical-plotting.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Create Basic Plots**:
   - Start by creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of a single variable.
   - Use a scatter plot to explore relationships between two numerical variables.
   - Generate box plots to identify outliers and understand data spread.

4. **Enhance Your Visuals**:
   - Customize your plots with titles, labels, and legends to make them informative.
   - Experiment with different color palettes in Seaborn to improve aesthetics.

5. **Document Your Findings**:
   - Write down insights you gain from each plot. What trends do you notice? Are there any surprising results?

6. **Save Your Plots**:
   - Use Matplotlib’s `savefig()` function to save your visualizations as images.

## Example Code Snippet 💻
Here’s a quick example to get you started:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Create a histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['column_name'], bins=30)
plt.title('Histogram of Column Name')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion 🎉
Today’s task has equipped you with essential skills in statistical plotting using Python. Remember that effective data visualization is key to communicating your findings clearly. Keep practicing with different datasets and plot types!
