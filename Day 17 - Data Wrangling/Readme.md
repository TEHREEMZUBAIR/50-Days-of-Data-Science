### Task Overview
Welcome to Day 17 of the **50 Days of Data Science** challenge! Today, we focus on **Data Wrangling**, an indispensable skill for any data scientist. 

### Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data.
- Transform data into structured formats.
- Gain insights through effective data manipulation.

### What We Did
1. **Data Loading**: We started by loading our dataset using Pandas.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: We identified and addressed missing values through imputation or removal.
3. **Data Transformation**: We transformed data types and created new features to enhance our dataset.
4. **Data Filtering**: We filtered the dataset to focus on relevant information.
5. **Final Review**: We conducted a final review to ensure our dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

### Instructions
