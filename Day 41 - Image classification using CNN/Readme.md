# 🖼️ Image Classification using CNNs - Day 41 Task 🚀

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to **Day 41**! Today, you will be working on **Image Classification** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. You will dive deeper into building a robust image classifier, optimizing the architecture, and exploring how CNNs can classify images into different categories. 📸

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions 🔧

Before jumping into the task, ensure you have all the tools and libraries set up. Here's what you’ll need:

1. **Python 3.7+** 🐍
2. **Jupyter Notebook** (If not installed, you can use `pip install jupyter`)
3. **Keras** and **TensorFlow**:
   ```bash
   pip install keras tensorflow
   ```

4. You’ll also be using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** for handling data and visualizations. They should be included in the standard Keras installation.

## 🖼️ CNN Overview

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a deep learning model that's particularly well-suited for image-related tasks, like classification and object detection. CNNs process image data using **convolutional layers** to extract features, **pooling layers** to reduce the spatial dimensions, and **fully connected layers** to classify the features. 🧠✨

## 📝 Task Details

### 1. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing 🛠️**

First, you’ll be working with an image dataset for classification. If you're using CIFAR-10 or another dataset, here’s how to load and preprocess it:

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   ```python
   from keras.datasets import cifar10
   (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = cifar10.load_data()
   ```

2. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
   - Convert labels to **one-hot encoding** using `to_categorical`.

   ```python
   from keras.utils import to_categorical
   train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255
   test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255
   train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels, 10)
   test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels, 10)
   ```

### 2. **Building the CNN Architecture 🏗️**

Now, it's time to build your CNN architecture. Follow this basic architecture, or feel free to customize it as you go! 🧑‍💻

- **Input Layer**: Input shape (32, 32, 3) for CIFAR-10 images.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the size of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential()

# First Conv2D Layer
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

# Second Conv2D Layer
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

# Flatten the feature maps
model.add(Flatten())

# Dense Layer
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))

# Dropout for regularization
model.add(Dropout(0.5))

# Output Layer for 10 classes
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

### 3. **Compiling the CNN ⚙️**

Once your model architecture is ready, compile the model using **Adam** optimizer and **categorical cross-entropy** as the loss function:

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

---

### 4. **Training the Model 🏋️**

Train your CNN with the training data for a specified number of epochs. Provide the test data for validation during training:

```python
history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
```

---

### 5. **Evaluating the Model 📊**

Evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset. You can also visualize the training history to see how well the model has learned:

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")
```

- You can also visualize the training and validation accuracy using **Matplotlib**:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot training & validation accuracy
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])
plt.title('Model accuracy')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.legend(['Train', 'Validation'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

### 6. **Saving the Model 💾**

Once you’re happy with the model’s performance, save the model for future use:

```python
model.save('cnn_model.h5')
```

---

### 7. **Optional Enhancements 🌟**

Feeling adventurous? Here are some optional steps you can explore:

1. **Data Augmentation 🤸**:
   Apply transformations like flipping, rotation, and zoom to increase the diversity of your dataset:

   ```python
   from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
   
   datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=20, width_shift_range=0.2, height_shift_range=0.2, horizontal_flip=True)
   datagen.fit(train_images)
   ```

2. **Regularization**:
   Add more dropout layers or try L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.

3. **Experiment with Different Architectures**:
   Try adding more convolutional layers or increase the filter size for better accuracy. 🛠️

4. **Visualizing Filters 🎨**:
   Visualize what your model is learning from the convolutional filters.
