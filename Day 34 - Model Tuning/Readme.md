# Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques

## **Overview**

This task explores various hyperparameter tuning techniques used to optimize machine learning models. Hyperparameters are external variables set before the training process, and tuning them correctly is essential to achieving the best performance from a model. The notebook demonstrates the use of different tuning methods on both classification and regression models.

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to understand the difference between parameters and hyperparameters, and to learn how to tune hyperparameters using several techniques, thereby improving model performance.

## **Dataset Description**

Two types of datasets are used for this task:

1. **Classification Dataset**: For tasks like predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam).
2. **Regression Dataset**: For predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).

Both datasets are generated synthetically within the notebook using `make_classification` and `make_regression` from `sklearn.datasets`.

## **Techniques for Hyperparameter Tuning**

### 1. **Manual Search**
   - Involves manually selecting hyperparameter values and running the model multiple times to observe performance changes.

### 2. **Random Search**
   - Randomly selects hyperparameter values from a given range and evaluates model performance based on those configurations.

### 3. **Grid Search**
   - A systematic method that evaluates all possible combinations of specified hyperparameter values to find the optimal set.

### 4. **Halving**
   - A variant of Grid Search or Random Search, but focuses on speeding up the process by allocating fewer resources to poorly performing configurations early in the search.

### 5. **Bayesian Optimization**
   - Uses probabilistic models to choose hyperparameters that are likely to improve model performance.

## **Tools and Libraries**

- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `scipy`: For statistical functions.
  - `scikit-learn`: For generating datasets, building models, and performing hyperparameter tuning.
