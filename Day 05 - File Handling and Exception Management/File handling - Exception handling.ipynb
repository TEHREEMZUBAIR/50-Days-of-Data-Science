FILE HANDLING**\n- File handling in Python allows us to store data that can be accessed by our code for various purposes like reading, writing, modifying and deleting data from files. \n\n- It also allows us to treat a file as an object so that all these operations can be performed on the file.\n\n- In python we have several functions for creating, reading , updating and deleting of the files.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **File Opening**\n- The key function in working with files is the open() function that allows us to open the file.\n- open() function returns a file object.\n- It takes two arguments:\n\n**1. Filename** \n   - In filename we have to specify the filename with the correct extension and with complete relative or absolute path.\n   - If we are using relative path then the file will be checked in the current directory but if we use the absolute path then the path will be located from the root directory.     \n\n**2. Mode**\n   - The second parameter is the mode of the file in which we are trying to open it. \n   - There are four type of modes in python\n>     Read (\"r\") -  Default\n>     Append (\"a\")\n>     Write (\"w\")\n>     Create (\"x\")\n   - Additionally we can also choose to open the file in \n>     Text Mode (\"t\")  -  Default\n>     Binary Mode (\"b\") \n\n**\"A binary file is a file whose content is in a binary format consisting of a series of sequential bytes, each of which is eight bits in length.

EXCEPTION HANDLING IN PYTHON**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program’s execution. They are raised when an error occurs during program execution, whether due to incorrect code, unexpected input, or other issues.\n\n**Why Do Exceptions appear?**\nExceptions appear when the Python interpreter encounters a situation it doesn't know how to handle. For example:\n* Trying to divide by zero\n* Accessing an index that doesn’t exist in a list\n* Using a variable that hasn’t been defined\n* And many other scenarios\n\n**Types of exceptions:**\nPython has many built-in exceptions, and you can also define your own. Here are some common built-in exceptions:\n\n* **SyntaxError:** Raised when the Python parser encounters a syntax error.\n* **TypeError:** Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n* **NameError:** Raised when a local or global name is not found.\n* **IndexError:** Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.\n* **KeyError:** Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n* **ValueError:** Raised when a function gets an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.\n* **AttributeError:** Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.\n* **IOError:** Raised when an I/O operation (like a file open) fails for an I/O-related reason.\n* **ZeroDivisionError:** Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.\n* **ImportError:** Raised when an import statement fails to find the module definition or when a from statement to find a name that is to be imported.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **How to Handle Exceptions**\n**Basic Syntax**\nTo handle exceptions, you use the try and except blocks.
