# 🎨 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Day 40 Task 🧠

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to **Day 40**! Today’s task is all about **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, one of the most powerful tools in deep learning, especially for image-related tasks. 📸 By the end of this day, you'll have built and trained a CNN, experimenting with different layers and understanding how CNNs work with image data.

Let’s get started! 🚀

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions 🔧
Before diving into the task, ensure your environment is set up correctly. You’ll be working with **Keras** and **TensorFlow**, so make sure they are installed:

1. **Python** (version 3.7+ recommended) 🐍
2. **Jupyter Notebook** (if not installed, run `pip install jupyter`)
3. **Keras** and **TensorFlow**: If you haven’t installed these already, use:

   ```bash
   pip install keras tensorflow
   ```

4. You’ll also need libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, but they usually come pre-installed with Keras.

## 📚 CNN Overview
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a type of deep learning model designed to work particularly well with image data. It consists of **convolutional layers** that extract features from the images and **pooling layers** that down-sample the features. Finally, **fully connected layers** are used for the final classification or regression task. 💡

## 💻 Task Details
### 1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset 📦**
You’ll be working with an image dataset, possibly **CIFAR-10** or another dataset provided in your notebook. Follow these steps:

1. **Load the Dataset**:

   ```python
   from keras.datasets import cifar10
   (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = cifar10.load_data()
   ```

2. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
   - Convert labels to **one-hot encoding** using `to_categorical`.

   ```python
   from keras.utils import to_categorical
   train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255
   test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255
   train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels, 10)
   test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels, 10)
   ```

### 2. **Designing the CNN Architecture 🏗️**
Now, let’s build the architecture of your CNN. Here’s a basic example to get started:

- **Input Layer**: (32x32x3) for CIFAR-10 images.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the size of the feature maps.
- **Dense Layers**: For classification.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential()

# Convolutional Layer 1
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

# Convolutional Layer 2
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

# Flatten the feature maps
model.add(Flatten())

# Fully Connected Layer
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))

# Dropout for regularization (optional)
model.add(Dropout(0.5))

# Output Layer
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

### 3. **Compiling the Model ⚙️**
After designing the model, compile it with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics:

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

---

### 4. **Train the CNN 🏋️**
Train your CNN with the training data. Use `model.fit()` to train the model, providing validation data for performance evaluation:

```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
```

- **Epochs**: This controls how many times the model will pass through the dataset.
- **Batch Size**: This defines how many samples the model sees at once before updating the weights.

---

### 5. **Evaluate the Model 📊**
Once the model is trained, you need to evaluate its performance using the test dataset:

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")
```

## 🎨 Extra Tasks for Exploration
Feel free to spice things up with some extra tasks! Here are some optional things to explore:

1. **Data Augmentation 🤸**: Use `ImageDataGenerator` to randomly flip, rotate, and shift images, which will help generalize your model.
   ```python
   from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
   
   datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=20, horizontal_flip=True)
   datagen.fit(train_images)
   ```

2. **Experiment with More Layers 🏗️**: Add more convolutional or dense layers to see how it affects performance.

3. **Visualize Filters 🎨**: Visualize what the filters (kernels) in the convolutional layers are learning. 🧐

4. **Regularization 🛡️**: Add **Dropout** layers to prevent overfitting.
