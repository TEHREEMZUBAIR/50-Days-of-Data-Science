# Data Preprocessing Using Scikit-Learn

## **Overview**

Data preprocessing is a critical step in any machine learning project. It involves preparing raw data for modeling by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and more. This notebook demonstrates several preprocessing techniques using the Scikit-Learn library, ensuring that the data is clean and suitable for machine learning models.

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to explore various data preprocessing techniques and understand how they can be applied to both classification and regression problems. By the end of this task, you will be able to:
- Scale numerical data.
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical data.
- Split data into training and testing sets.

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this task is a wine dataset, which contains various chemical properties of wine, including:
- **Type**: The class label (1, 2, or 3).
- **Alcohol**: The alcohol content in wine.
- **Proline**: The amount of proline (a type of amino acid) in wine.

## **Preprocessing Techniques Covered**

### 1. **Standardization**
   - Standardization transforms data so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
   - This is important when features have different scales, as many machine learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input data.

### 2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Missing data can arise due to errors in data collection or other factors.
   - Techniques like imputation (filling in missing values with mean, median, or most frequent value) are covered in this notebook.

### 3. **Encoding Categorical Data**
   - Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical values for machine learning models.
   - The notebook demonstrates techniques like one-hot encoding to convert categories into a suitable format for modeling.

### 4. **Train-Test Split**
   - Data is split into training and testing sets to ensure that the model can generalize to unseen data.
   - Scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function is used to divide the dataset, typically with an 80/20 or 70/30 ratio.

## **Tools and Libraries**

- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `scikit-learn`: For preprocessing, modeling, and splitting data.

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the repository** or download the Jupyter notebook (`preprocessing-using-scikit-learn.ipynb`).
2. Ensure the following libraries are installed:
   - `pandas`

   You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook preprocessing-using-scikit-learn.ipynb
   ```

4. Execute the cells step-by-step to run through various preprocessing techniques.

## **Project Structure**

- **preprocessing-using-scikit-learn.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that walks through the preprocessing steps, including data standardization, missing value handling, and encoding categorical data.
  
## **Conclusion**

Preprocessing is an essential step in preparing data for machine learning. This notebook helps you understand how to use Scikit-learn's powerful tools to clean, transform, and standardize data for better model performance.
