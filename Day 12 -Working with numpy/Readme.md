# Day 12 - Working with Random Data in NumPy

Welcome to Day 12 of the 50 Days of Data Science Challenge. Today, we will be diving into the world of random number generation using NumPy. Follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.

## Task Instructions

1. **Generate an Array from a Uniform Distribution**  
   Create a 1D array with 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.

2. **Create a 2x2 Matrix of Random Integers**  
   Generate a 2x2 matrix with random integers between 1 and 100.

3. **Generate Random Normal Distribution**  
   Generate an array of 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Print the first 10 numbers to check.

4. **Create a 5x5 Matrix of Random Integers**  
   Generate a 5x5 matrix of random integers from a uniform distribution between 10 and 50.

5. **Calculate Cumulative Sum**  
   Given a 1D array, calculate and print the cumulative sum of its elements.

6. **Simulate Drawing from a Normal Distribution**  
   Simulate drawing 100 samples from a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. Print the first 10 samples.

7. **Generate a 3x3 Matrix of Random Uniform Values**  
   Generate a 3x3 matrix of random values from a uniform distribution between -5 and 5.
