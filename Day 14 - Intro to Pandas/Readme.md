# Day 13 - Exploring Population Data with Pandas üåçüìä

Welcome to Day 13 of the 50 Days of Data Science Challenge! Today, you will work with a world population dataset using **Pandas**. Your tasks will involve filtering data by continent, calculating populations, and extracting useful insights. Let‚Äôs get started! üöÄ

## Task Instructions üìù

1. **Load the Data**  
   Load the population data into a Pandas DataFrame. The dataset contains columns such as country, continent, year, population, and other details.

2. **Filter by Continent**  
   Filter the dataset to show only the data for **Europe**.

3. **Calculate Total Population of Europe**  
   Using the filtered dataset, calculate the total population of all European countries.

4. **Group by Continent**  
   Group the data by the `continent` column and calculate the total population for each continent.

5. **Filter by Year**  
   Filter the dataset to show data for the year **2018** and calculate the total world population for that year.

6. **Find Countries with Population > 100 Million**  
   Filter the dataset to show countries with a population greater than 100 million and print the results.

7. **Calculate the Average Population by Continent**  
   Group the data by continent and calculate the average population for each continent.
