
## **Task Title: Introduction to Jupyter Notebook**

### **Task Overview**
This task is aimed at familiarizing users with Jupyter Notebook, an essential tool for data science projects. It covers the basic functionality and types of cells used in a notebook, including Markdown, Code, and Raw cells. By completing this task, users will gain a foundational understanding of how to interact with and execute code within a Jupyter environment.

### **Task Objectives**
1. Understand the structure and purpose of Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Explore the different types of cells (Markdown, Code, Raw).
3. Learn how to execute code in Jupyter and display the results.
4. Create and format Markdown cells to document your work.
5. Add and run Python code in Code cells.
6. Practice switching between different cell types.

### **Requirements**
- Python installed locally or using an environment like Anaconda.
- Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it by running:
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

### **Steps to Complete the Task**
1. **Markdown Cells**: Learn how to write formatted text in Jupyter using Markdown cells for documentation. Use headings, lists, bold, italics, and links.
   
2. **Code Cells**: Write Python code in Code cells and run the code to see the output.
   
3. **Raw Cells**: Understand the usage of Raw cells, which store content without rendering it in the notebook.

4. **Executing Cells**: Learn to execute the cells using the toolbar or the keyboard shortcuts (`Shift + Enter`).

5. **Notebook Interaction**: Save, share, and export the notebook in various formats (e.g., HTML, PDF).

### **Example Notebook Workflow**
- Add a Markdown cell and type a brief description of what you will be doing.
- Create a Code cell and write a simple Python code to print "Hello, Data Science!"
- Add another Markdown cell to document your code.
- Add a Raw cell and observe that it does not render.
  
### **Task Deliverables**
- A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) with a mix of Markdown, Code, and Raw cells demonstrating your understanding of the notebook's functionality.
